# 3D models for the proejct
## Camera mount and case for hardware
This branch contains the 3D models (STL) to replicate this project.

## Slicer Settings (Cura 5.1)
#### Basic settings
Resolution: 0.2 (0.4mm nozzle)\
Line Width: 0.4 (Default)\
Infill: 10% - 20%\
Infill pattern: Grid

#### Supports

Supports: Optional\
Structure: Normal\
Placement: Everywhere\
Support: 80.0°\
Pattern: Zig Zag\
Infill Density: 10.0

**Note:** Everything can be printed without supports, but supports are recommended for:
- [Bolt.stl](https://github.com/Sabshine/Python-Checkers-Robot/blob/3d-models/Checkers%20Computer%20-%20Case/Button%20Holders/Bolt.stl) Hightly recommended
- [Case Top.stl](https://github.com/Sabshine/Python-Checkers-Robot/blob/3d-models/Checkers%20Computer%20-%20Case/Case/Case%20Top.stl) Place it with the opening facing up (angle is 65° so supports are not necessairy to print the angled side)

#### Adhesion (Optional if your printer has problems with buildplate adhesion)
Buildplate Adhesion: Brim
